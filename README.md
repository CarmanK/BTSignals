# Philips Hue Light Controller
This was a fun project done for my Signals and Systems class.

The project was designed with Node.js and consists of a simple webapp developed with Express that acts as a control panel. The data is POSTed from the panel to the server and relayed to a Philips Hue bridge to adjust all connected lightbulbs. Since the only bulbs I had available were simple white ones, I could only test adjusting their brightness, but controls for more complicated RGB bulbs would be easy to implement now that the groundwork is completed.
